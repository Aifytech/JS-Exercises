This is my first repository for git tutorial.
I learned how to create new or change to the directory that I want to work on.
I also learned to create a git repository.
I also learned to list the files in the directory and also check the git status to see if these files are part of our repo.
The files in the repo can either be tracked, that is added to repo and are ready to be commited or untracked, that is still in the working area.
